During my PhD applications, I found useful to have access to samples research proposal. From what I gathered, the research proposal is an exercise that attempts to demonstrate wether a student can succinctly describe the existing literature on a chosen topic and propose new directions. It is not meant to be strictly followed during your PhD but rather is used as en exercise. I eventually got into my first PhD choice(Cambridge) which means its content is not too bad. I hope that sharing my proposal may help someone write theirs.
