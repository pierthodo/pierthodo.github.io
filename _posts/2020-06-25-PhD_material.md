title: PhD research proposal
cover-img: cambridge.jpg
---

During my PhD applications, I found it useful to have access to samples research proposals. From what I gathered, the research proposal is an exercise that attempts to demonstrate whether a student can succinctly describe the existing literature on a chosen topic and propose new directions. It is not meant to be strictly followed during your PhD but rather is used as an exercise. I luckily got into my first PhD choice(Cambridge) with this proposal. I hope that sharing my proposal may be useful for someone.
