I am a researcher in the MILA institute under the supervision of Dr Pineau and currently working towards a Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at McGill University. My research focuses on reinforcement learning and machine learning for healthcare. During the summer of 2017 I was an intern at IBM Research Israel in the Machine Learning for Healthcare group under the supervision of Dr El-Hay. My first degree was in Mathematics and Computer Science at McGill University.
